## 0.6.7004.1

* Fixed quadratic slowdown in `removeEmpty`.

* Fixed `read` compatibility with time-1.9 in test suite.

## 0.6.7004.0

* Many changes to the documentation that use the new names.  See entry
  for version 0.6.7000.0.

* Added `fromPGSFromField` to replace `fieldQueryRunnerColumn`.

* Added `fromPGSFieldParser` to replace `fieldParserQueryRunnerColumn`.

* Added `defaultFromField` to replace `queryRunnerColumnDefault`.

* Added `tableField` to replace `tableColumn`.

* Added `unsafeFromField` to replace `queryRunnerColumn`.

* Added `toFieldsExplicit` to replace `constantExplicit`.

* Added `TableRecordField` to replace `TableField` in
  `Opaleye.TypeFamilies`.  The latter may be used to replace
  `TableColumn` in the future.

* Added array functions `arrayAppend`, `arrayRemove`, `arrayRemoveNulls`.

## 0.6.7003.1

* Bumped some depedencies so there is an install plan on GHC 8.6

## 0.6.7003.0

* Add `tableField` as a future replacement for `tableColumn`

* Export `Opaleye.Field` and `Opaleye.RunSelect` from `Opaleye`

* Use new nomenclature in tutorials

## 0.6.7002.0

This is a breaking release that doesn't follow the PVP but because
it's essentially a pre-release for version 0.7 I'm just going to
blacklist the broken versions on Hackage and forget about it.

* Swapped `N` and `NN` because they were the wrong way round.

## 0.6.7001.0

* Fix bug with infinity in range bounds

* Fix incompatibility with GHC 8.4

* Add range accessors, `upperBound` and `lowerBound`

* Add `distinctOn` and `distinctOnBy`

## 0.6.7000.0

This is a pre-release of version 0.7.0.0.  GHC >= 8.0 is required.  It
contains the following new important features

* A new API for manipulation, including `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`
  support for `UPDATE`

* Initial support for product types written in "Higher kinded data"
  style (but deriving of related functionality using TH or Generics is
  not yet provided).

* Type inference for outer joins

* Many renamings.  In particular, `Column` will become `Field` in
  0.7.0.0.  You should be able to almost completely port your code to
  the 0.7.0.0 names whilst remaining compatible with 0.6.7000.0.
